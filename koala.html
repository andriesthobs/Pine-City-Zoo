                <h3>KOALAS</h3>
                <p>The koala (Phascolarctos cinereus) is an arboreal herbivorous marsupial native to Australia. It is easily recognisable by its stout, tailless body and large head with round, fluffy ears and large, spoon-shaped nose. Koalas typically inhabit open eucalypt woodlands, and the leaves of these trees make up most of their diet. Koalas are largely sedentary and sleep up to 20 hours a day.</p>
                <p>They are asocial animals, and bonding exists only between mothers and dependent offspring. Being marsupials, koalas give birth to underdeveloped young that crawl into their mothers' pouches, where they stay for six to seven months. These joeys are fully weaned around a year old.</p>
                <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</strong></p>
                <p>You will find the koalas next to the giraffe enclosure.</p>
