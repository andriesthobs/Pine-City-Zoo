        <h3>PANDAS</h3>
        <p>The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) is a bear native to south central China. It is easily recognized by the large, distinctive black patches around its eyes, over the ears, and across its round body. Though it belongs to the order Carnivora, the giant panda's diet is over 99% bamboo.</p>
        <p>In the wild, they will occasionally eat grasses, tubers, or small animals. In captivity, their diet is supplemented with fruits, eggs, and specially prepared foods. Pandas are conservation reliant and endangered.</p>
        <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</strong></p>
        <p>You will find the pandas at Panda Canyon.</p>
